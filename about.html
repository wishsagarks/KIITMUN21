KIIT International MUN has hosted a chain of successful editions since its maiden conference in 2013. Establishing the stronghold in its maiden year itself, KIITMUN was able to uphold the caliber of its diplomats and its commitment to making an impact, and since then the event has been setting the benchmark a little higher with every edition. The anticipation keeps escalating each year - starting with a few participants in 2013 to 2,500 in 2016 to over 2000 in 2019 - we have come a long way since. Our enormous world is divided by its selfish interests and we strive to make it smaller and united by bringing in participation from not just the renowned institutions and organizations of our nation, but from countries that span every corner of the world.<br><br>

In its previous editions, KIIT International MUN had been graced by eminent personalities from all walks of life. It has been a stage for veteran comedians like Biswa Kalyan Rath, Kenny Sebastian, Rahul Subramanian, and Abish Mathew shared at the same time by the likes of Mr. Kamal Singh, the Executive Director of UN Global Compact Network India; Allen Gammel OBE, Director of the British Council India; Padma Bhushan Mr. Rajat Sharma; Mr. Suhel Seth, distinguished Speaker, and Actor; Mr. Akhilesh Yadav, Former Chief Minister, Uttar Pradesh; Debanjan Chakrabarti – Director British Council, East India; Mr. Punya Prasun Bajpai, the news anchor and executive editor at Aaj Tak, Mr. Hector Cueva Jacome, Ambassador of Ecuador in India; Mr. Fleming Raul Duarte Ramos, Ambassador of Paraguay to India; Mr. Claudio Ansorena Montero, Ambassador of Costa Rica to India and Mrs. Barbara Wickham, Director of British Council in India. Since its first edition, the popularity and significance of the conference have grown exponentially; hosting eminent personalities to conducting resourceful working shops, inclemently deliberating about global concerns for an entire day with representatives of other nations and dancing, singing, and celebrating with the same people at the end of the day.<br><br>

KIIT International Model UN has successfully catered to diplomacy and merriment of the participants alike and has played such a pivotal role in bringing about a revolution in the Model United Nations circuit that the dilemmas that were dissected into by these young delegates seemed a bit more surmountable.

Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences (KISS) is a residential school providing free education, room 
and board, medical care, vocational, athletic and artistic training to 60,000 indigenous children 
(30,000 students in KISS, Bhubanseswar, 15,000 Alumni and 15,000 students in 10 satellite 
centres of KISS in Odisha) from 62 different tribal groups. <br><br>

It started really small with 125 students in 1992-93 with an aim to give decent life to the poorest of the poor tribal children. In the course of its existence for the last 27 years, it has become a revolution among tribal population to eradicate poverty through Education. KISS has become the first exclusive tribal deemed to be university in the World, the status accorded by Ministry of Human Resources Development, 
Government of India.  <br><br>



KISS stands for Gender Equity, Vocational Empowerment and Women Empowerment based on the 3E formula of “Enable, Educate and Empower.” It has been in special consultative status with ECOSOC since 2015 and works in close collaboration with UNO and its agencies and organs. The most important principle of the success of this model is the indigenous control of education, where importance is given to preserving the culture, heritage and traditions of tribal communities.

Prof. Achyuta Samanta is an educationist, philanthropist, and social worker. He is the founder of Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT) and Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences (KISS), both educational institutions of global repute and recognition. KIIT is an Institution of Eminence and one of the most prominent universities in India and globe for professional education having more than 30,000 students from all over India and 53 other countries. KISS is a home for 60,000 indigenous children all absolutely free.<br><br> 

Besides Education and tribal upliftment, healthcare and rural development, Shri. Samanta has contributed immensely to art, culture, literature, film, media, society and national integration. It is really incredible that the child who lost his father at the age of four, brought up amidst severe poverty and deprivation with seven siblings and a widow mother in a quaint village in Odisha has accomplished this monumental work without any favour or backing in such a short span of time for the society. He has converted the remote village ‘Kalarabanka’, Cuttack into a Smart Village and the entire Manpur Panchayat into a model Panchayat (cluster of villages).<br><br> 

He has been conferred with more than 50 International and National awards and over 200 state awards besides two highest Civilian Awards from Royal Kingdom of Bahrain and Mongolia. He has been conferred with 44 Honorary Doctorate awards from universities in India and abroad. He is the first Odia to be a member of both UGC and AICTE. He is currently the Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha) from Kandhamal, Odisha and also the President of Volleyball Federation of India.<br><br> 

As a social reformer, he has been propagating “Art of Giving” (philosophy of life), a concept aimed at bringing peace and happiness around the globe. <br><br> 

Despite all his achievements, he leads a simple lifestyle, keeps on marching towards the cause of spreading smile among millions and achieving zero poverty, zero hunger, zero illiteracy.

One of the oldest civilizations in the world, India is a mosaic of multicultural experiences. With a rich heritage and myriad attractions, the country is among the most popular tourist destinations in the world. It covers an area of 32, 87,263 sq. km, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity.

Fringed by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. As you travel the expanse of the country, you are greeted by diverse nuances of cuisines, faiths, arts, crafts, music, nature, lands, tribes, history, and adventure sports. India has a mesmeric conflation of the old and the new. As the bustling old bazaars rub shoulders with swanky shopping malls, and majestic monuments accompany luxurious heritage hotels, the quintessential traveler can get the best of both worlds. Head to the mountains, enjoy a beach retreat, or cruise through the golden Thar, India has options galore for all.
India is home to the finest architectural heritage, serene ghats, spectacular landscapes, and the largest tiger reserve.
