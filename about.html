            <hr>
            <span class="third" style="font-size: 17px;" >
                KIIT International MUN has been hosting a chain of successful editions since its inception in 2013.
                Having established the stronghold in its debut edition, KIIT MUN has been able to uphold the calibre of
                its diplomats and its commitment to making an impact, and ever since, the event has been setting a
                benchmark a little higher with every edition. The anticipation keeps escalating with each year and we
                have come a long way- starting with a meagre number of participants in 2013 to 2,500 in 2016, we kept
                things consistent and the growth static up till 2019 with the same enthusiasm. The enormous world is
                divided by its selfish interests and we strive to make it smaller, uniting it in the process through
                participation from not just the renowned institutions and organisations in our nation, but from
                countries and nations from every nook and corner of the world.<br><br>

                In its previous editions, KIIT International MUN, the largest MUN of its kind in South Asia, has been
                graced by the presence of eminent personalities who are renowned in all walks of life. KIIT
                International MUN has been a stage for various comedians like Bishwa Kalyan Rath, Kenny Sebastian, Rahul
                Subramanian, Abish Mathew, and Gaurav Kapur, the platform shared by the likes of Mr Kamal Singh, the
                Executive Director of UN Global Compact Network India, Allen Gammel OBE, Director of the British Council
                India, Debanjan Chakrabarti – Director British Council, East India, and by a plethora of foreign
                diplomats and emissaries like Mr Hector Cueva Jacome, Ambassador of Ecuador in India; Mr Fleming Raul
                Duarte Ramos, Ambassador of Paraguay to India; Mr Claudio Ansorena Montero, Ambassador of Costa Rica to
                India and Mrs Barbara Wickham, Director of British Council in India, political personalities like
                Akhilesh Yadav, and other distinguished speakers and diplomats.
                Since the very first edition, the significance and popularity of the conference have grown
                exponentially; hosting esteemed personalities to conduct resourceful workshops, deliberating about
                global concerns for an entire day with representatives of other nations and celebrating together through
                music and dance, amidst smiles.
                Even amidst the global pandemic, KIIT International MUN adapted to the virtual mode of organising the
                conference in 2021, successfully bringing together around 450 delegates from every nook and corner of
                the nation. Not letting the circumstances and the non-feasibility of organising the conference
                physically deter, KIIT International eMUN was made a success. From diplomats and dignitaries who graced
                the occasion virtually to a stand-up comedy show featuring Mr Gaurav Kapur, the spirit of MUN was upheld
                triumphantly
                <br><br>
                KIIT International Model United Nations has successfully catered to diplomacy and merriment of
                participants and has played a pivotal role in bringing about a revolution in the MUN circuit that the
                dilemmas that were dissected into by young delegates, seemed a bit more surmountable. With a beautiful
                legacy, KIIT International MUN looks forward to be organised with more devout enthusiasm and
                participation than ever before, taking into account each success, and looking out to ameliorate and
                uphold the very spirit of a united world.

                            Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences (KISS) is a residential school providing free
                            education, room
                            and board, medical care, vocational, athletic and artistic training to 60,000 indigenous
                            children
                            (30,000 students in KISS, Bhubanseswar, 15,000 Alumni and 15,000 students in 10 satellite
                            centres of KISS in Odisha) from 62 different tribal groups. <br><br>

                            It started really small with 125 students in 1992-93 with an aim to give decent life to the
                            poorest of the poor tribal children. In the course of its existence for the last 27 years,
                            it has become a revolution among tribal population to eradicate poverty through Education.
                            KISS has become the first exclusive tribal deemed to be university in the World, the status
                            accorded by Ministry of Human Resources Development,
                            Government of India. <br><br>



                            KISS stands for Gender Equity, Vocational Empowerment and Women Empowerment based on the 3E
                            formula of “Enable, Educate and Empower.” It has been in special consultative status with
                            ECOSOC since 2015 and works in close collaboration with UNO and its agencies and organs. The
                            most important principle of the success of this model is the indigenous control of
                            education, where importance is given to preserving the culture, heritage and traditions of
                            tribal communities.

                Despite all his achievements, he leads a simple lifestyle, keeps on marching towards the cause of
                spreading smile among millions and achieving zero poverty, zero hunger, zero illiteracy.

                One of the oldest civilizations in the world, India is a mosaic of multicultural experiences. With a
                rich heritage and myriad attractions, the country is among the most popular tourist destinations in the
                world. It covers an area of 32, 87,263 sq. km, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the
                tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the
                rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct
                geographical entity.

                Fringed by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers
                off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. As you
                travel the expanse of the country, you are greeted by diverse nuances of cuisines, faiths, arts, crafts,
                music, nature, lands, tribes, history, and adventure sports. India has a mesmeric conflation of the old
                and the new. As the bustling old bazaars rub shoulders with swanky shopping malls, and majestic
                monuments accompany luxurious heritage hotels, the quintessential traveler can get the best of both
                worlds. Head to the mountains, enjoy a beach retreat, or cruise through the golden Thar, India has
                options galore for all.
                India is home to the finest architectural heritage, serene ghats, spectacular landscapes, and the
                largest tiger reserve.
