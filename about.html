                One of India's top universities, Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT), is famous for the
                caliber of its teaching and research. It was established as an industrial training institute in
                Bhubaneswar in 1992–1993, in a leased home with 12 pupils and 2 teachers. In the age of unpopular
                schooling and much cautious embracing of globalization, Prof. Achyuta Samanta had a vision for a school
                that would emphasize
                academic excellence and offer uncountable chances for students to acquire comprehensive knowledge with
                very little financial support.
                <br><br>

                With just three programmes to begin with—Engineering, MBA, and MCA—KIIT's dedication to quality led to
                the Ministry of HRD, Government of India, awarding it Deemed to be University status under Section 3 of
                UGC Act, 1956, in 2004. This made KIIT the earliest Institute to achieve the distinction of obtaining
                University status in less than 6 years, which has been proudly inscribed in the Limca Book of Records.
                It has been ranked No. 1 among self-financing institutions of the country in the Atal Ranking of
                Institutions on Innovation Achievements (ARIIA), 2022 of the Ministry of Education, Government of India.
                It is India's 1st QS 5 Stars Rated University (QS World University Ranking) and is the only University
                of India to hold the Prestigious ISAS badge (International Associations of University) and the only
                University of India to win the The Awards Asia for Leadership and Management by Times Higher Education
                Rankings for its unstinting commitment to its staff and students. Recently, KIIT ranked 8th globally for
                Reducing Inequalities by the Times Higher Education Impact Rankings 2022 and also ranked 20th by NIRF,
                Govt. of India.on.

                <br><br>
                30,000 students are educated at KIIT, who come from 65 different nations and all around India. Through
                its 23 schools, it offers more than 115 academic programmes, and more than 195 international
                organizations collaborate with it in the workplace. More than 100 multinational corporations and
                numerous national companies obtain their personnel from KIIT for placement. For its outstanding
                contribution in the field of sports and games, KIIT has been awarded as the best Sports University of
                India (Sportstar Aces Award). The University has a long history of holding numerous international and
                national seminars, congresses, workshops, and even important sporting events in practically every topic
                of interest. With its expansive 25 Square Kilometer Academic Township, 23 World Class Campuses, 2500+
                illustrious Faculty and Researchers, 16 Sports Complexes, largest indoor and outdoor stadiums of any
                university, 15 Food Courts, and greenest campus in India, KIIT offers a holistic approach to human
                development that is unmatched in the nation.

                            illustrious Faculty and Researchers, 16 Sports Complexes, largest indoor and outdoor
                            stadiums of any university, 15
                            Food Courts, and greenest campus in India, KIIT offers a holistic approach to human
                            development that is unmatched in the nation.<br><br>
                            In terms of social and economic empowerment, KIIT University's outreach programme is
                            enormous. Sports have received virtually no support in terms of developing athletes and
                            building sports facilities. The accomplishments of the students and their sense of community
                            on campus and in their workplaces after graduation have motivated us to push even harder to
                            achieve greater levels of excellence. Instead of resting on its past success and rapid
                            expansion, KIIT looks forward to reaching greater heights in academics, research, and global
                            rankings.

                            The Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences (KISS) is a residential institution providing free
                            education, accommodation , medical care, vocational, athletic & artistic training to 70,000
                            indigenous children. Of these, 30,000 students study at the main campus in Bhubaneswar,
                            20,000 are alumni and 10,000 study at 10 satellite centers of KISS across Odisha. It has
                            indirectly impacted over a million tribal children and youth. The students come from
                            62 different tribal groups within the region, of which 13 are Particularly Vulnerable Tribal
                            Groups (PVTGs). <br><br>

                            KISS was established in 1992 with the aim of using accessible, free education to empower
                            children from marginalized
                            communities. It has now grown to symbolize a revolution for tribal populations of India to
                            eradicate poverty through education. Over the course of its more than 28-year history, KISS
                            has peacefully intervened through education and empowerment to arrest dropouts, child
                            marriage, gender-based harassment, left-wing extremism, proselytising, illiteracy, and
                            superstition on a huge scale. It has raised awareness of the value of education, the
                            empowerment of girls, upskilling and vocational empowerment, entrepreneurship, and
                            cooperation with tribal groups as guardians of the environment and the natural
                            world.<br><br>



                            Since 2015, UN-ECOSOC has granted KISS Special Consultative Status, making it the first
                            unique tribal Deemed to Be University in the world. While making sure that the model
                            prioritizes indigenous ownership of education, to maintain the history, legacy, and customs
                            of India's different tribal tribes, and to fully realize the Sustainable Development Goals
                            2030, KISS proudly adheres to the 3E approach—Educate, Enable, Empower.

                One of the oldest civilizations in the world, India is a mosaic of multicultural experiences. With a
                rich heritage and myriad attractions, the country is among the most popular tourist destinations in the
                world. It covers an area of 32, 87,263 sq. km, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the
                tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the
                rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct
                geographical entity.

                Fringed by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers
                off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. As you
                travel the expanse of the country, you are greeted by diverse nuances of cuisines, faiths, arts, crafts,
                music, nature, lands, tribes, history, and adventure sports. India has a mesmeric conflation of the old
                and the new. As the bustling old bazaars rub shoulders with swanky shopping malls, and majestic
                monuments accompany luxurious heritage hotels, the quintessential traveler can get the best of both
                worlds. Head to the mountains, enjoy a beach retreat, or cruise through the golden Thar, India has
                options galore for all.
                India is home to the finest architectural heritage, serene ghats, spectacular landscapes, and the
                largest tiger reserve.
